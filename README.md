## Course Overview

In this course, you will:
- Learn the basics of Python programming.
- Explore essential libraries like `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `SciPy`.
- Perform statistical analyses, such as t-tests and correlation tests.
- Create visualizations to interpret and present data.
  
**Course Goals:**
- Equip students with practical data analysis skills applicable in biology and medical contexts.
- Build confidence in programming for scientific research.

## Structure

The course content is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of Python and data analysis:

1. **Introduction to Python**  
   - Basics of Python syntax
   - Data types, variables, and basic operators

2. **Data Manipulation with Pandas**  
   - DataFrames and Series
   - Data cleaning, filtering, and manipulation

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Plotting with Matplotlib and Seaborn
   - Creating histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, and more

4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests)
   - Correlation analysis and interpreting results

5. **Advanced Topics**  
   - Tips and tricks for more efficient analysis
   - Visualization best practices

## Prerequisites

This course assumes no prior programming knowledge. However, students should have a basic understanding of biology or chemistry, as examples and datasets are drawn from these fields.

## Course Materials

- **Lecture Notes**: Found in each module folder
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Hands-on coding exercises and examples
- **Assignments**: Weekly assignments to practice the concepts covered
- **Datasets**: Relevant datasets included in each module to facilitate practice and exploration
